# Get Connected 4 All

*Get Connected 4 All* is a searchable directory of all the public facilities where New York City residents without the necessary equipment to work online can access the computer and the internet.

# Technology Stack
* This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/), an open-source JavaScript library that allows developers to build user interfaces for single-page applications and create reusable components.

## API
* The [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/react-map) is in use and allows users to map the facility they would like to visit.
* The [NYC OpenData API](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) generates the public facilities by a user's zipcode.

# Run the Application
